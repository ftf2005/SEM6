      <h2>About Iron Man</h2>
      <p>Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, is a brilliant inventor and engineer who creates a high-tech suit to save his life and later uses it to fight against evil. His journey from a wealthy, self-centered businessman to a hero who sacrifices everything for the greater good is one of the most iconic in superhero history.</p>
      <p>He became a symbol of resilience and innovation, constantly upgrading his suits and becoming a pivotal member of the Avengers. Today, Iron Man remains a symbol of hope, determination, and the power of technology.</p>
